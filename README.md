There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## CreativeConnect ##
  <!-- > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->

<!-- ## Market ## -->
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  > CreativeConnect is for anybody who is looking to start a project and wants a place to both aggregate inspiration and connect with the human beings behind that inspiration. 

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  > One of the first steps people often take when starting on a new creative project is to put together a mood board to flesh out the direction they want to go in. What if you could easily make and add to a mood board, choosing from a wealth of resources, and then directly contact the maker behind that work? With CreativeConnect, you can do all of that in one place. CreativeConnect uses the Behance API to connect the user with millions of creators across over one hundred creative fields, allowing the user to add works to their board and easily connect with the creators themselves, so you can communicate with them and potentially commission them for your project.   

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  > Too often applications like Pinterest and Tumblr give users a place to collect visual inspiration, but the actual link between the work and its original creator is lost. The creator does not get the credit they deserve, and the user does not have a way to connect with them to find the rest of their work or commission them. 

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  > With CreativeConnect, you don't have to dig through multiple pages or do any reverse image searches to find the person who made the work you like. With one click, you can contact that person directly, supporting the individual artists and designers on the other side of the screen. 

## Quote from the Maker ##
  <!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  > "When creative works can be easily linked with the people who worked hard to make them, everybody wins."

## How to Get Started ##
  <!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  > Just search for what you want, and start clicking search results to add them to your board! 

## Customer Quote ##
  <!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  > "It was so easy to commission the illustrator whose work I loved so much to do some pieces for my website!"

## In Conclusion ##
  <!-- > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
